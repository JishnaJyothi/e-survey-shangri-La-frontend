<br /><br />

## Project Review
Climate change and global warming affect all regions around the world, and the Valley of Shangri-La is not
an exception. Shangri-La City Council has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2 and
N2O from transport. It plans to introduce SLEZ (Shangri-L Low Emission Zone) to the city by the end of 2022
and install more electric vehicle charging stations.<br />
The Shangri-La City Council has decided to open public consultation on its plans to implement SLEZ, and the
residents are being asked to offer their opinions on the detail and the proposed boundaries of SLEZ.<br />
There are two types of account in e-Survey: (1) Resident user account, and (2) Council Officer account:<br />

### Resident user account(User) :
Can attend the survey questions by registering and then logging on to the user portal.</br>
• A user can view a list of multiple-choice questions as part of the consultation.<br />
• A user can select one question from the list to respond.<br />
• For each of the questions, the user is allowed to choose exactly one option.<br />
• A user cannot edit the response to an already submitted question or retake it.<br />
### Council Officer account(Admin) :
A council officer have the following permissions.
• Add/Delete/Edit consultation questions.
